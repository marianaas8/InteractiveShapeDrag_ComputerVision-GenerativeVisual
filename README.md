# Interactive Shape Drag 
**A fun and interactive game that uses hand tracking to control geometric shapes!**  
This project combines computer vision and generative visuals to create a simple game where the user drags shapes into corresponding holes using their index finger, detected through the webcam. Developed with **p5.js** and **ml5.js**, it provides an intuitive, gesture-based experience.
